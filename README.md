====

This project aims to design and implement a portable HealthCare equipment.
For the sensor interface, this project uses an **Arduino** Uno microcontroller.  
For connecting different sensors to the Arduino board, this project has also designed a **custom shield**.  
For controlling the interface, as well as showing the measurements results, this project uses an **Android** application.

## Project Features
1. Bluetooh communication protocol.
2. Android application.
3. Electrocardiogram generation :chart_with_upwards_trend:
4. Body temperature measurement.
5. Blood pressure measurement.
6. SPO2 measurement.
7. Respiratory rate measurement.
8. Lung capacity measurement.
9. ShiftBrite RGB LED control.
10. Function LEDs control via *multiplexer*.
